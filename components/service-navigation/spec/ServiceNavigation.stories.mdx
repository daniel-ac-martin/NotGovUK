# Service navigation

Service navigation helps users understand that they’re using your service and lets them navigate around your service.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="ServiceNavigation">
    <ServiceNavigation items={[
      {
        href: "/styles",
        text: "Navigation item 1"
      },
      {
        href: "#active",
        text: "Navigation item 2",
      },
      {
        href: "/contributing",
        text: "Navigation item 3"
      }
    ]} />
  </Story>
</Preview>

<Props of={ ServiceNavigation } />


## When to use this component

Use the Service navigation to help users understand that they’re using your service.

To decide when to use navigation links in your service, see the [Help users to navigate a service pattern].


## How it works

Together, the [GOV.UK header component] and Service navigation component ensure users get a consistent experience on GOV.UK.

This also assures users that they’re in the right place to use your service and to understand that GOV.UK functions as one website.

For guidance on how to plan your header and navigation, see the [Help users navigate a service pattern].


### Change the blue colour bar under the GOV.UK header to full width

To use the GOV.UK header and Service navigation and make them fit together visually, you’ll need to change the bottom blue border of the GOV.UK header to full width.

Apply a class `govuk-header--full-width-border` to the GOV.UK header.

<Preview>
  <Story name="With header">
    <>
    <Header govUK classModifiers="full-width-border" />
    <ServiceNavigation items={[
      {
        href: "/styles",
        text: "Navigation item 1"
      },
      {
        href: "#active",
        text: "Navigation item 2",
      },
      {
        href: "/contributing",
        text: "Navigation item 3"
      }
    ]} />
    </>
  </Story>
</Preview>


### Showing your service name only

We recommend that you use the Service navigation component to show your service name, instead of the GOV.UK header, and to start updating existing services.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Service name">
    <ServiceNavigation serviceName="Service name" serviceHref="#" />
  </Story>
</Preview>


### Showing service name and navigation links

Show navigation links to let users navigate to different parts of your service and find useful links and tools.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Full">
    <ServiceNavigation
      serviceName="Service name"
      serviceHref="#"
      items={[
        {
          href: "/styles",
          text: "Navigation item 1"
        },
        {
          href: "#active",
          text: "Navigation item 2",
        },
        {
          href: "/contributing",
          text: "Navigation item 3"
        }
      ]}
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>
