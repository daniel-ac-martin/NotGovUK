# Link

<p><Tag text="Pseudo-component" /></p>

A drop in replacement for the standard HTML `<a>` tag, with GovUK styling, that
supports fast, client-side navigation.

Links are blue and underlined by default. If your link is at the end of a
sentence or paragraph, make sure that the linked text does not include the full
stop.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Link">
    <A href="#">Text</A>
  </Story>
</Preview>

<Props of={A} />


## When to use this component

Use this component wherever you would normally use a normal HTML `<a>` tag.


## How it works

It wraps the `Link` component from [React Router] and so allows the router to
handle the links without a page reload when possible.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Standard">
    <A href="#">Text</A>
  </Story>
</Preview>


### External links

If it’s an external link to a non-government website, make that clear in the
link text. For example, ‘read advice on writing link text from [name of
organisation]’. There’s no need to say explicitly that you’re linking to an
external site. [Do not use an external link icon].


### No visited state

Use the `no-visited-state` modifier class where it is not helpful to distinguish
between visited and unvisited states, for example when linking to pages with
frequently-changing content such as the dashboard for an admin interface.

<Preview>
  <Story name="No visited state">
    <A href="#" classModifiers="no-visited-state">Text</A>
  </Story>
</Preview>


### Opening links in a new tab

Avoid opening links in a new tab or window. It can be disorienting - and [can
cause accessibility problems for people who aren’t able to visually perceive
that the new tab has opened].

If you need a link to open in a new tab - for example, to stop the user losing
information they’ve entered into a form - then include the words ‘opens in new
tab’ as part of the link. There’s no need to say ‘tab or window’, since opening
in a new tab is the default behaviour for most browsers.

Include `rel="noreferrer noopener"` along with `target="_blank"` to reduce the
risk of [reverse tabnabbing]. The following example shows how to do this in HTML.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Open in new tab">
    <A href="#" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Text</A>
  </Story>
</Preview>

If you’re displaying lots of links together and want to save space and avoid repetition, consider doing both of the following:

- adding a line of text before the links saying ‘The following links open in a new tab’
- including `<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">(opens in new tab)</span>` as part of the link text, so that part of the link text is visually hidden but still accessible to screen readers


### Links on dark backgrounds

Use the `govuk-link--inverse` modifier class to show white links on dark backgrounds – for example, in headers, custom components, and patterns with darker backgrounds.

Make sure all users can see the links – the white links and background colour [must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1].

<Preview>
  <Story name="Dark backgrounds">
    <Panel classModifiers="interruption">
      <p>
        <A classModifiers="inverse" href="#">Text</A>
      </p>
    </Panel>
  </Story>
</Preview>


### Links without underlines

Use the `govuk-link--no-underline` modifier class to remove underlines from links.

Only do this if the context tells the user that the text is a link, even without the underline.

For example, links in a header or side navigation might not need underlines. Users will understand that they’re links because of where they are, at the same place, across different pages.

<Preview>
  <Story name="No underline">
    <A href="#" classModifier="no-underline">Text</A>
  </Story>
</Preview>


### Links to change a language

You can use links to allow a user to access the current content in a different language.

When offering links to content in other languages, make sure:

- the link’s text includes the name of the alternative language in both English and the source language
- the link’s purpose is always clear, even when taken out of context
- the link element includes an [`hreflang` attribute] that identifies the language of the linked page.

For example, your link text could be ‘use [Service name] in [language]’.
