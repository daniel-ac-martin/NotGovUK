# Date input

Use the date input component to help users enter a memorable date or one they
can easily look up.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="DateInput">
    <DateInput
      label={<h1 className="govuk-heading-l">When was your passport issued?</h1>}
      name="passport-issued"
      hint="For example, 12 11 2007"
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>

<Props of={ DateInput } />


## When to use this component

Use the date input component when you’re asking users for a date they’ll already
know, or can look up without using a calendar.


## When not to use this component

Do not use the date input component if users are unlikely to know the exact date
of the event you’re asking about.

Read more about how to ask users for dates.


## How it works

The date input component consists of 3 fields to let users enter a day, month
and year.

The 3 date fields are grouped together in a `<fieldset>` with a `<legend>` that
describes them, as shown in the examples on this page. This is usually a
question, like ‘What is your date of birth?’.

If you’re asking [one question per page], you can set the contents of the
`<legend>` as the page heading. This is good practice as it means that users of
screen readers will only hear the contents once.

Read more about [why and how to set legends as headings].

<Preview>
  <Story name="Standard">
    <DateInput
      label={<h1 className="govuk-heading-l">When was your passport issued?</h1>}
      name="passport-issued"
      hint="For example, 12 11 2007"
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>

Never automatically tab users between the fields of the date input because this
can be confusing and may clash with normal keyboard controls.


### If you’re asking more than one question on the page

If you’re asking more than one question on the page, do not set the contents of
the `<label>` as the page heading. Read more about [asking multiple questions on
question pages].

<Preview>
  <Story name="No heading">
    <DateInput
      label="When was your passport issued?"
      name="passport-issued"
      hint="For example, 12 11 2007"
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>


### Use the autocomplete attribute for a date of birth

Use the autocomplete attribute on the date input component when you’re asking
for a date of birth. This lets browsers autofill the information on a user’s
behalf if they’ve entered it previously.

To do this, set the autocomplete prop to `bday`. See how to do this in the code
snippet in the following example.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Auto-complete">
    <DateInput
      label={<h1 className="govuk-heading-l">What is your date of birth?</h1>}
      name="dob"
      hint="For example, 31 3 1980"
      autoComplete="bday"
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>

If you are working in production you’ll need to do this to meet [WCAG 2.1 Level
AA].

You will not normally need to use the `autoComplete` attribute in prototypes, as
users will not generally be using their own devices.


### Error messages

Error messages should be styled like this:

<Preview>
  <Story name="Errors">
    <DateInput
      label={<h1 className="govuk-heading-l">When was your passport issued?</h1>}
      name="passport-issued"
      hint="For example, 12 11 2007"
      error="The date your passport was issued must be in the past"
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>

If you’re highlighting just one field - either the day, month or year - only style the field that has an error. The error message must say which field has an error, like this:

<Preview>
  <Story name="SubErrors">
    <DateInput
      label={<h1 className="govuk-heading-l">When was your passport issued?</h1>}
      name="passport-issued"
      hint="For example, 12 11 2007"
      error={{
        year: 'The date your passport was issued must include a year'
      }}
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>


Make sure errors follow the guidance in error message and have specific error
messages for specific error states.

If there’s more than one error, show the highest priority error message. In order of priority, show error messages about:

- missing or incomplete information
- information that cannot be correct (for example, the number ‘13’ in the month field)
- information that fails validation for another reason


#### If nothing is entered

Say ‘Enter [whatever it is]’.

For example, ‘Enter your date of birth’.


#### If an incomplete date is entered and you know what is missing

Say ‘[whatever it is] must include a [whatever is missing]’.

For example, ‘Date of birth must include a month’ or ‘Date of birth must include a day and month’.


#### If an incomplete date is entered and you do not know what is missing

Say ‘Enter [whatever it is] and include a day, month and year’.

For example, ‘Enter your date of birth and include a day, month and year’.


#### If the date entered is not a real one

Say ‘Enter a real [whatever it is]’.

For example, ‘Enter a real date of birth’.


#### If the date is in the future when it needs to be in the past

Say ‘[whatever it is] must be in the past’.

For example, ‘Date of birth must be in the past’.


#### If the date is in the future when it needs to be today or in the past

Say ‘[whatever it is] must be today or in the past’.

For example, ‘Date of birth must be today or in the past’.


#### If the date is in the past when it needs to be in the future

Say ‘[whatever it is] must be in the future’.

For example, ‘The date your course ends must be in the future’.


#### If the date is in the past when it needs to be today or in the future

Say ‘[whatever it is] must be today or in the future’.

For example, ‘The date your course ends must be today or in the future’.


#### If the date must be the same as or after another date

Say ‘[whatever it is] must be the same as or after [date and optional description]’.

For example, ‘The date your course ends must be the same as or after 1 September 2017 when you started the course’.


#### If the date must be after another date

Say ‘[whatever it is] must be after [date and optional description]’.

For example, ‘The day your course ends must be after 1 September 2017’.


#### If the date must be the same as or before another date

Say ‘[whatever it is] must be the same as or before [date and optional description]’.

For example, ‘The date of Gordon’s last exam must be the same as or before 31 August 2017 when they left school’.


#### If the date must be before another date

Say ‘[whatever it is] must be before [date and optional description]’.

For example, ‘The date of Gordon’s last exam must be the same as or before 31 August 2017’.


#### If the date must be between two dates

Say ‘[whatever it is] must be between [date] and [date and optional description]’.

For example, ‘The date your contract started must be between 1 September 2017 and 30 September 2017 when you were self-employed’.
