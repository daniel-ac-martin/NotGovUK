# Details

Make a page easier to scan by letting users reveal more detailed information only if they need it.

<Primary />
<Controls />


## When to use this component

Use the details component to make a page easier to scan when it contains information that only some users will need.


## When not to use this component

Do not use the details component to hide information that the majority of your users will need.


## Details, accordions and tabs

Details, accordions, and tabs all hide sections of content which a user can choose to reveal.

Use the details component instead of tabs or an accordion if you only have 1 section of content.

The details component is less visually prominent than tabs and accordions, so tends to work better for content which is not as important to users.


## How it works

The details component is a short link that expands into more detailed help text when a user clicks on it.

<Canvas of={Stories.Standard} />


## Write clear link text

Make the link text short and descriptive so users can quickly work out if they need to click on it.
