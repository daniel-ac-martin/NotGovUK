# Header

The GOV.UK header shows users that they are on GOV.UK and which service they are using.

This implementation also supports websites not hosted on GOV.UK by
replacing the crown logo. It also provides explicit support for
individual government departments by through the use of the appropriate
departmental colours.

<Primary />
<Controls />


## When to use this component

You must use the GOV.UK header at the top of every page if your service
is being hosted on one of these domains:

- gov.uk/myservice
- myservice.service.gov.uk
- myblog.blog.gov.uk

It can be used elsewhere as long as `govUK` mode is _NOT_ enabled.


## When not to use this component

You must not use the GOV.UK header if your service is not being hosted on
one of the above domains. However, you can still use this component if
you disable `govUK` mode which will remove GDS' crown logo.


## Stories
### Standard

A standard Header. This does not include GDS' crown logo and is suitable
for use outside of GOV.UK including internal application and websites of
local councils.

<Canvas of={Stories.Standard} />


### Default GOV.UK header

Use the default GOV.UK header if your service is hosted on GOV.UK and has
5 pages or fewer.

<Canvas of={Stories.GOVUK} />


### Re-branded GOV.UK header

The default header for public facing websites on GOV.UK, after 25th June 2025.

Add the `rebrand` prop, and ensure that a parent element, such as `<html>`, has the `govuk-template--rebranded` class.

<Canvas of={Stories.RebrandedGOVUK} />


### Header with service name

<Canvas of={Stories.ServiceName} />


### Header with service name and navigation

<p><Tag text="Deprecated" /></p>

Use the header with navigation if you need to include basic navigation,
contact or account management links.

You should now use the [Service navigation] component instead.

<Canvas of={Stories.Navigation} />


### Header with service name and sign-out link

<p><Tag text="Deprecated" /></p>

A sign-out link can be provided and added to the end of the list of
navigation links.

You should now use the [Service navigation] component instead.

<Canvas of={Stories.SignOut} />


### Full width

A header that does _NOT_ restrict the width on wide screens.

<Canvas of={Stories.FullWidth} />


### Custom logo

A custom logo can be provided, via the `logo` prop.

<Canvas of={Stories.CustomLogo} />


### No logo

The logo can be removed entirely by passing `null` to the `logo` prop.
