# Header

The GOV.UK header shows users that they are on GOV.UK and which service they are using.

This implementation also supports websites not hosted on GOV.UK by
replacing the crown logo. It also provides explicit support for
individual government departments by through the use of the appropriate
departmental colours.

## When to use this component

You must use the GOV.UK header at the top of every page if your service
is being hosted on one of these domains:

- gov.uk/myservice
- myservice.service.gov.uk
- myblog.blog.gov.uk

It can be used elsewhere as long as `govUK` mode is _NOT_ enabled.


## When not to use this component

You must not use the GOV.UK header if your service is not being hosted on
one of the above domains. However, you can still use this component if
you disable `govUK` mode which will remove GDS' crown logo.
