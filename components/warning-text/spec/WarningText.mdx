# Warning text

A component to warn the user of something important.

<Primary />
<Controls />


## When to use this component

Use the warning text component when you need to warn users about something important, such as legal consequences of an action, or lack of action, that they might take.


## How it works

You might need to rewrite the hidden, assistive, text (‘Warning’ in the example) to make it appropriate for your context.

## Stories
### Standard

A standard Warning text.

<Canvas of={Stories.Standard} />


### Custom assistive text

Warning text with custom hidden text for users of screen-readers.

<Canvas of={Stories.CustomAssistive} />
