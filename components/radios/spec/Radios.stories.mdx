## When to use this component

Use the radios component when users can only select one option from a list.


## When not to use this component

Do not use the radios component if users might need to select more than one
option. In this case, you should use the checkboxes component instead.


## How it works

Radios are grouped together in a `<fieldset>` with a `<legend>` that describes
them, as shown in the examples on this page. This is usually a question, like
‘Where do you live?’.

If you are asking just one question per page as recommended, you can set the
contents of the `<legend>` as the page heading. This is good practice as it
means that users of screen readers will only hear the contents once.

Read more about why and how to set legends as headings.

Always position radios to the left of their labels. This makes them easier to
find, especially for users of screen magnifiers.

Unlike with checkboxes, users can only select one option from a list of radios.
Do not assume that users will know how many options they can select based on the
visual difference between radios and checkboxes alone.

If needed, add a hint explaining this, for example, ‘Select one option’.

Do not pre-select radio options as this makes it more likely that users will:

- not realise they’ve missed a question
- submit the wrong answer

Users cannot go back to having no option selected once they have selected one,
without refreshing their browser window. Therefore, you should include ‘None of
the above’ or ‘I do not know’ if they are valid options.

Order radio options alphabetically by default.

In some cases, it can be helpful to order them from most-to-least common
options. For example, you could order options for ‘Where do you live?’ based on
population size.

However you should do this with extreme caution as it can reinforce bias in your
service. If in doubt, order alphabetically.

Group radios together in a `<fieldset>` with a `<legend>` that describes them,
as shown in the examples on this page. This is usually a question, like ‘Where
do you live?’.


### If you’re asking one question on the page

If you’re asking just [one question per page] as recommended, you can set the
contents of the `<legend>` as the page heading. This is good practice as it
means that users of screen readers will only hear the contents once.

Read more about [why and how to set legends as headings].

<Preview>
  <Story name="Standard">
    <Radios
      label={<h1 className="govuk-heading-l">Where do you live?</h1>}
      name="where-do-you-live"
      options={[
        { value: 'england', label: 'England' },
        { value: 'scotland', label: 'Scotland' },
        { value: 'wales', label: 'Wales' },
        { value: 'northern-ireland', label: 'Northern Ireland' }
      ]}
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>


### If you’re asking more than one question on the page

If you’re asking more than one question on the page, do not set the contents of
the `<legend>` as the page heading. Read more about [asking multiple questions
on question pages].

<Preview>
  <Story name="No heading">
    <Radios
      label="Where do you live?"
      name="where-do-you-live"
      options={[
        { value: 'england', label: 'England' },
        { value: 'scotland', label: 'Scotland' },
        { value: 'wales', label: 'Wales' },
        { value: 'northern-ireland', label: 'Northern Ireland' }
      ]}
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>


### Inline radios

In some cases, you can choose to display radios ‘inline’ beside one another
(horizontally).

Only use inline radios when:

- the question only has two options
- both options are short

Remember that on small screens such as mobile devices, the radios will still be
‘stacked’ on top of one another (vertically).

<Preview>
  <Story name="Inline">
    <Radios
      classModifiers="inline"
      hint="This includes changing your last name or spelling your name differently."
      label={<h1 className="govuk-heading-l">Have you changed your name?</h1>}
      name="changed-name"
      options={[
        { value: 'yes', label: 'Yes' },
        { value: 'no', label: 'No' }
      ]}
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>


### Radio items with hints

You can add hints to radio items to provide additional information about the
options.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Hints">
    <Radios
      label={<h1 className="govuk-heading-l">How do you want to sign in?</h1>}
      name="sign-in"
      options={[
        {
          value: 'government-gateway',
          label: 'Sign in with Government Gateway',
          hint: 'You’ll have a user ID if you’ve registered for Self Assessment or filed a tax return online before.'
        },
        {
          value: 'govuk-verify',
          label: 'Sign in with GOV.UK Verify',
          hint: 'You’ll have an account if you’ve already proved your identity with either Barclays, CitizenSafe, Digidentity, Experian, Post Office, Royal Mail or SecureIdentity.'
        }
      ]}
      hint="This includes changing your last name or spelling your name differently."
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>


### Radio items with a text divider

If one or more of your radio options is different from the others, it can help
users if you separate them using a text divider. The text is usually the word
‘or’.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Divider">
    <Radios
      label={<h1 className="govuk-heading-l">Where do you live?</h1>}
      name="where-do-you-live"
      options={[
        { value: 'england', label: 'England' },
        { value: 'scotland', label: 'Scotland' },
        { value: 'wales', label: 'Wales' },
        { value: 'northern-ireland', label: 'Northern Ireland' },
        'or',
        { value: 'abroad', label: 'I am a British citizen living abroad' }
      ]}
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>


### Conditionally revealing content

Using this component, you can add conditionally revealing content to stacked
radios, so users only see content when it’s relevant to them.

For example, you could reveal an email address input only when a user chooses to
be contacted by email.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Content">
    <Radios
      label={<h1 className="govuk-heading-l">How would you prefer to be contacted?</h1>}
      name="how-contacted"
      options={[
        {
          value: 'email',
          label: 'Email',
          conditional: (
            <TextInput
              autoComplete="email"
              className="govuk-!-width-one-third"
              id="contact-by-email"
              label="Email address"
              name="contact-by-email"
              spellCheck={false}
              type="email"
            />
          )
        },
        {
          value: 'phone',
          label: 'Phone',
          conditional: (
            <TextInput
              autoComplete="tel"
              className="govuk-!-width-one-third"
              id="contact-by-phone"
              label="Phone number"
              name="contact-by-phone"
              spellCheck={false}
              type="tel"
            />
          )
        },
        {
          value: 'text message',
          label: 'Text message',
          conditional: (
            <TextInput
              autoComplete="tel"
              className="govuk-!-width-one-third"
              id="contact-by-text"
              label="Mobile phone number"
              name="contact-by-text"
              spellCheck={false}
              type="tel"
            />
          )
        }
      ]}
      hint="Select one option."
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>


Keep it simple. If the related question is complicated or has more than one
part, show it on the next page in the process instead.

Do not conditionally reveal questions to inline radios, such as ‘yes’ and ‘no’
options placed next to each other.

Conditionally reveal questions only - do not show or hide anything that is not a
question.


#### Known issues

Users are not always notified when a conditionally revealed question is shown or
hidden. This fails [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value].

However, we found that screen reader users did not have difficulty answering a
conditionally revealed question - as long as it’s kept simple. It confused our
test users when we conditionally revealed complicated questions to them.

We’ll keep looking for opportunities to [learn more about how conditionally
revealed questions should be used in services].


### Smaller radios

Use standard-sized radios in nearly all cases. However, smaller versions work
well on pages where it’s helpful to make them less visually prominent.

For example, on a page of search results, the primary user need is to see the
results. Using smaller radios lets users see and change search filters without
distracting them from the main content.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Small">
    <Radios
      classModifiers="small"
      label={<h3>Filter</h3>}
      name="filter"
      options={[
        { value: 'month', label: 'Monthly' },
        { value: 'year', label: 'Yearly' }
      ]}
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>


Small radios can work well on information dense screens in services designed for
repeat use, like caseworking systems.

In services like these, the risk that they will not be noticed is lower because
users return to the screen multiple times.


### Error messages

Display an error message if the user has not:

- selected any radios
- answered a conditionally revealed question

Error messages should be styled like this:

<Preview>
  <Story name="Errors">
    <Radios
      error="Select the country where you live"
      label={<h1 className="govuk-heading-l">Where do you live?</h1>}
      name="where-do-you-live"
      options={[
        { value: 'england', label: 'England' },
        { value: 'scotland', label: 'Scotland' },
        { value: 'wales', label: 'Wales' },
        { value: 'northern-ireland', label: 'Northern Ireland' }
      ]}
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>

Make sure errors follow the guidance in the [Error message component] and have
specific error messages for specific error states.


#### If it’s a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ question

Say ‘Select yes if [whatever it is is true]’. For example, ‘Select yes if Sarah
normally lives with you’.


#### If there are two options which are not ‘yes’ and ‘no’

Say ‘Select if [whatever it is]’. For example, ‘Select if you are employed or
self-employed’.


#### If there are more than two options

Say ‘Select [whatever it is]’. For example, ‘Select the day of the week you pay
your rent’.


#### If it’s a conditionally revealed question

Include an [Error message component] that is clearly related to the initial
question.

<Preview>
  <Story name="ContentError">
    <Radios
      defaultValue="email"
      label={<h1 className="govuk-heading-l">How would you prefer to be contacted?</h1>}
      name="how-contacted-error"
      options={[
        {
          value: 'email',
          label: 'Email',
          conditional: (
            <TextInput
              autoComplete="email"
              className="govuk-!-width-one-third"
              error="Email address cannot be blank"
              id="contact-by-email"
              label="Email address"
              name="contact-by-email"
              spellCheck={false}
              type="email"
            />
          )
        },
        {
          value: 'phone',
          label: 'Phone',
          conditional: (
            <TextInput
              autoComplete="tel"
              className="govuk-!-width-one-third"
              id="contact-by-phone"
              label="Phone number"
              name="contact-by-phone"
              spellCheck={false}
              type="tel"
            />
          )
        },
        {
          value: 'text message',
          label: 'Text message',
          conditional: (
            <TextInput
              autoComplete="tel"
              className="govuk-!-width-one-third"
              id="contact-by-text"
              label="Mobile phone number"
              name="contact-by-text"
              spellCheck={false}
              type="tel"
            />
          )
        }
