# Skip link

Use the skip link component to help keyboard-only users skip to the main content on a page.

<Primary />
<Controls />


## When to use this component

All GOV.UK pages must include a skip link in the header.


## How it works

Some people use the tab key on their keyboard to navigate through the links and form elements on a web page.

Including the skip link component gives users the option to bypass the top-level navigation links and jump to the main content on a page.

The skip link component is visually hidden until a keyboard press activates it.
