# Form field

<p><Tag text="Unofficial" /></p>

A component for colecting a piece of data from the user. The type of form field
that is rendered will depend on the props that are supplied to it. For example,
providing a few options will cause it to render as some radio buttons.

> **Note:** To use this as part of the wider forms framework, you should instead
>           import the `Form` component and replace `FormField` in the examples
>           below with `Form.Field`.

<Primary />
<Controls />


## How it works

With minimal props it will render as a simple text field.

<Canvas of={Stories.Standard} />


### Multi-line

By adding a `rows` prop that is greater than `1` we get a textarea of that size.

<Canvas of={Stories.Multiline} />


### Dates

It's also possible to force a certain rendering mode by using the `type` prop.
The most common use for this is to ask for dates by setting it to `date`.

<Canvas of={Stories.Date} />


#### Date picker

If you prefer, you can still use the browser's native, date-picker by setting
the `type` props to `native-date`.

<Canvas of={Stories.Datepicker} />


### Selecting from options

If you want the user to only answer from a list of options just provide an
`options` prop.


#### A single choice from few options

Providing very few option will give you radios.

<Canvas of={Stories.Singlechoicefew} />


#### A single choice from more options

Providing more options will give you small radios.

<Canvas of={Stories.Singlechoicesome} />


#### A single choice from more options

Providing lots of options will give you a select box. (Note that these do not
test well with users!)

<Canvas of={Stories.Singlechoicemany} />


#### Multiple choices

If you want the user to be able to select multiple options just add the
`multiple` prop.

<Canvas of={Stories.Multiplechoicesome} />

#### Multiple choices from many options

If you provide a lot of options you will get a muilt-select box. (Note that
these do not test well with users!)

<Canvas of={Stories.Multiplechoicemany} />
