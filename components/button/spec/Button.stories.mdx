## When to use this component

Use the button component to help users carry out an action like starting an
application or saving their information.


## How it works

Write button text in sentence case, describing the action it performs. For
example:

- ‘Start now’ at the [start of the service]
- ‘Sign in’ to an account a user has already created
- ‘Continue’ when the service does not save a user’s information
- ‘Save and continue’ when the service does save a user’s information
- ‘Save and come back later’ when a user can save their information and come
  back later
- ‘Add another’ to add another item to a list or group
- ‘Pay’ to make a payment
- ‘Confirm and send’ on a [check answers] page that does not have any legal
  content a user must agree to
- ‘Accept and send’ on a [check answers] page that has legal content a user must
  agree to
- ‘Sign out’ when a user is signed in to an account

You may need to include more or different words to better describe the action.
For example, ‘Add another address’ and ‘Accept and claim a tax refund’.

Align the primary action button to the left edge of your form.


### Default buttons

Use a default button for the main call to action on a page.

Avoid using multiple default buttons on a single page. Having more than one main
call to action reduces their impact, and makes it harder for users to know what
to do next.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Standard">
    <Button>Save and continue</Button>
  </Story>
</Preview>


### Start buttons

Use a start button for the main call to action on your service’s [start page].
Start buttons do not submit form data, so they use a link tag rather than a
button tag.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Start">
    <StartButton href="#" />
  </Story>
</Preview>


### Secondary buttons

Use secondary buttons for secondary calls to action on a page.

Pages with too many calls to action make it hard for users to know what to do
next. Before adding lots of secondary buttons, try to simplify the page or break
the content down across multiple pages.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Secondary">
    <Button classModifiers="secondary">Find address</Button>
  </Story>
</Preview>

You can also [group default and secondary buttons together].


### Warning buttons

Warning buttons are designed to make users think carefully before they use them.
They only work if used very sparingly. Most services should not need one.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Warning">
    <Button classModifiers="warning">Delete account</Button>
  </Story>
</Preview>

Only use warning buttons for actions with serious destructive consequences that
cannot be easily undone by a user. For example, permanently deleting an account.

When letting users carry out an action like this, it’s a good idea to include an
additional step which asks them to confirm it.

In this instance, use another style of button for the initial call to action,
and a warning button for the final confirmation.

Do not only rely on the red colour of a warning button to communicate the
serious nature of the action. This is because not all users will be able to see
the colour or will understand what it signifies. Make sure the context and
button text make clear what will happen if the user selects it.


### Disabled buttons

Disabled buttons have poor contrast and can confuse some users, so avoid them if
possible.

Only use disabled buttons if research shows it makes the user interface easier
to understand.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Disabled">
    <Button disabled>Disabled button</Button>
  </Story>
</Preview>


### Grouping buttons

Use a button group when two or more buttons are placed together.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Group">
    <ButtonGroup>
      <Button>Save and continue</Button>
      <Button classModifiers="secondary">Save as draft</Button>
    </ButtonGroup>
  </Story>
</Preview>

Any links within a button group will automatically align with the buttons.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Group with link">
    <ButtonGroup>
      <Button>Continue</Button>
      <A href="#">Cancel</A>
    </ButtonGroup>
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Stop users from accidentally sending information more than once
#### IMPLEMENTME

Sometimes, users double click buttons because they:

- have used operating systems where they have to double click items to make them
  work
- are experiencing a slow connection which means they are not given feedback on
  their action quickly enough
- have motor impairments such as hand tremors which cause them to click the
  button involuntarily

In some cases, this can mean their information is sent twice.

For example, the GOV.UK Notify team discovered that a number of users were
receiving invitations twice, because the person sending them was double clicking
the ‘send’ button.

If you are working in production and research shows that users are frequently
sending information twice, you can configure the button to ignore the second
click.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Prevent double click">
    <Button data-prevent-double-click="true">Confirm and send</Button>
  </Story>
</Preview>

This feature will prevent double clicks for users that have JavaScript enabled,
however you should also think about the issue server-side to protect against
attacks.

In the case of slow connections, aim to give the user information about what’s
happening, for example, by showing a loading spinner or a modal, before using
`data-prevent-double-click`.


### Submit buttons

<p><Tag text="Unofficial" /></p>

When your button is a part of a form you will probably want to use a submit button.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Submit">
    <SubmitButton>Save and continue</SubmitButton>
  </Story>
</Preview>


### Hyperlinks

<p><Tag text="Unofficial" /></p>

When your button is not part of a form you will probably want it to be a hyperlink by providing a `href` prop.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Hyperlink">
    <Button href="#" classModifiers="secondary">New search</Button>
  </Story>
</Preview>
