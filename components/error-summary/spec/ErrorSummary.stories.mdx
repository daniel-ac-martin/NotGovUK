# Error summary

Use this component at the top of a page to summarise any errors a user has made.

When a user makes an error, you must show both an error summary and an [error message] next to each answer that contains an error.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="ErrorSummary">
    <ErrorSummary
      title="There is a problem"
      items={[
        {
          text: "The date your passport was issued must be in the past",
          href: "#"
        },
        {
          text: "Enter a postcode, like AA1 1AA",
          href: "#"
        }
      ]}
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>

<Props of={ ErrorSummary } />

## When to use this component

Always show an error summary when there is a validation error, even if there’s only one.

## How it works

You must:

- move keyboard focus to the error summary
- include the heading ‘There is a problem’
- link to each of the answers that have validation errors
- make sure the error messages in the error summary are worded the same as those which appear next to the inputs with errors

As well as showing an error summary, follow the [validation pattern] - for example, by adding ‘Error: ’ to the beginning of the page `<title>` so screen readers read it out as soon as possible.

And make your [error messages] clear and concise.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Standard">
    <ErrorSummary
      title="There is a problem"
      items={[
        {
          text: "The date your passport was issued must be in the past",
          href: "#"
        },
        {
          text: "Enter a postcode, like AA1 1AA",
          href: "#"
        }
      ]}
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Linking from the error summary to each answer

You must link the errors in the error summary to the answer they relate to.

For questions that require a user to answer using a single field, like a file upload, select, textarea, text input or character count, link to the field.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Linking">
    <Fragment>
      <ErrorSummary
        title="There is a problem"
        items={[
          {
            text: "Enter your full name",
            href: "#full-name-input"
          }
        ]}
      />
      <h1>Your details</h1>
      <TextInput
        id="full-name"
        label="Full name"
        name="name"
        autoComplete="name"
        error="Enter your full name"
      />
    </Fragment>
  </Story>
</Preview>

When a user has to enter their answer into multiple fields, such as the day, month and year fields in the date input component, link to the first field that contains an error.

If you do not know which field contains an error, link to the first field.

<Preview>
  <Story name="LinkingToDateInput">
    <Fragment>
      <ErrorSummary
        title="There is a problem"
        items={[
          {
            text: "The date your passport was issued must include a year",
            href: "#passport-issued-year"
          }
        ]}
      />
      <DateInput
        id="passport-issued"
        label={
          <h1 className="govuk-heading-l">
            When was your passport issued?
          </h1>
        }
        name="passport-issued"
        hint="For example, 12 11 2007"
        error={{
          year: "The date your passport was issued must include a year",
        }}
      />
    </Fragment>
  </Story>
</Preview>

For questions that require a user to select one or more options from a list using radios or checkboxes, link to the first radio or checkbox.

<Preview>
  <Story name="LinkingToCheckboxes">
    <Fragment>
      <ErrorSummary
        title="There is a problem"
        items={[
          {
            text: "Select if you are British, Irish or a citizen of a different country",
            href: "#nationality-checkbox-0"
          }
        ]}
      />
      <Checkboxes
        label={
          <h1 className="govuk-heading-l">
            What is your nationality?
          </h1>
        }
        name="nationality"
        options={[
          {
            value: "british",
            label: "British",
            hint: "including English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish",
          },
          {
            value: "irish",
            label: "Irish",
          },
          {
            value: "other",
            label: "Citizen of another country",
          },
        ]}
        hint="Select all that apply."
        error="Select if you are British, Irish or a citizen of a different country"
      />
    </Fragment>
  </Story>
</Preview>


### Where to put the error summary

Put the error summary at the top of the `main` container. If your page includes breadcrumbs or a back link, place it below these, but above the `<h1>`.

<Preview>
  <Story name="WhereToPut">
    <GovUKPage
      maxContentsWidth="690"
      serviceName="Service name"
      serviceHref="#"
      backHref="#"
    >
      <div className="govuk-grid-row">
        <div className="govuk-grid-column-two-thirds">
          <ErrorSummary
            title="There is a problem"
            items={[
              {
                text: "The date your passport was issued must include a year",
                href: "#passport-issued-year"
              }
            ]}
          />
          <DateInput
            id="passport-issued"
            label={
              <h1 className="govuk-heading-l">
                When was your passport issued?
              </h1>
            }
            name="passport-issued"
            hint="For example, 12 11 2007"
            error={{
              year: "The date your passport was issued must include a year",
            }}
          />
        </div>
      </div>
    </GovUKPage>
