# Breadcrumbs

The breadcrumbs component helps users to understand where they are within a website’s structure and move between levels.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Breadcrumbs">
    <Breadcrumbs
      items={[
        { text: 'Home', href: '#' },
        { text: 'Passports, travel and living abroad', href: '#' },
        { text: 'Travel abroad', href: '#' }
      ]}
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>

<Props of={ Breadcrumbs } />


## When to use this component

Use the breadcrumbs component when you need to help users understand and move between the multiple levels of a website.


## When not to use this component

Do not use the breadcrumbs component on websites with a flat structure, or to show progress through a linear journey or transaction.

If you’re using other navigational elements on the page, such as a sidebar, consider whether your users need the additional support of breadcrumbs.


## How it works

The breadcrumbs component should include the user’s current page, which should be visually different from the other links in the breadcrumb.


## Stories
### Standard

Standard Breadcrumbs.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Standard">
    <Breadcrumbs
      items={[
        { text: 'Home', href: '#' },
        { text: 'Passports, travel and living abroad', href: '#' },
        { text: 'Travel abroad', href: '#' }
      ]}
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>


### Collapsing breadcrumbs on mobile devices

If you have long breadcrumbs you can configure the component to only show the first and last items on mobile devices.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Collapsing">
    <Breadcrumbs
      classModifiers="collapse-on-mobile"
      items={[
        { text: "Home", href: "#" },
        { text: "Environment", href: "#" },
        { text: "Rural and countryside", href: '#' },
        { text: "Rural development and land management", href: '#' },
        { text: "Economic growth in rural areas", href: '#' }
      ]}
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>
