# Breadcrumbs

The breadcrumbs component helps users to understand where they are within a website’s structure and move between levels.

<Primary />
<Controls />


## When to use this component

Use the breadcrumbs component when you need to help users understand and move between the multiple levels of a website.


## When not to use this component

Do not use the breadcrumbs component on websites with a flat structure, or to show progress through a linear journey or transaction.

If you’re using other navigational elements on the page, such as a sidebar, consider whether your users need the additional support of breadcrumbs.


## How it works

The breadcrumbs component should include the user’s current page, which should be visually different from the other links in the breadcrumb.

### Collapsing breadcrumbs on mobile devices

If you have long breadcrumbs you can configure the component to only show the first and last items on mobile devices.

<Canvas of={Stories.Collapsing} />


### Breadcrumbs on dark backgrounds

Use the `govuk-breadcrumbs--inverse` modifier class to show white links and arrows on dark backgrounds – for example, in headers, custom components, and patterns with darker backgrounds.

Make sure all users can see the breadcrumbs – the background colour [must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1] with white.
