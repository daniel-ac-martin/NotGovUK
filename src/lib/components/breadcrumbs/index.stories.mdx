# Breadcrumbs

The breadcrumbs component helps users to understand where they are within a website’s structure and move between levels.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Breadcrumbs">
    <Breadcrumbs
      items={object('items', [
        { text: 'Section', href: '/section' },
        { text: 'SubSection', href: '/section/subsection' },
        { text: 'SubSection', href: '/section/subsection/subsection' }
      ])}
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>

<Props of={Breadcrumbs} />


## When to use this component

Use the breadcrumbs component when you need to help users understand and move between the multiple levels of a website.


## When not to use this component

Do not use the breadcrumbs component on websites with a flat structure, or to show progress through a linear journey or transaction.

If you’re using other navigational elements on the page, such as a sidebar, consider whether your users need the additional support of breadcrumbs.


## How it works

The breadcrumbs component should include the user’s current page, which should be visually different from the other links in the breadcrumb.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Standard">
    <Breadcrumbs
      items={[
        { text: 'Section', href: '/section' },
        { text: 'SubSection', href: '/section/subsection' },
        { text: 'SubSection', href: '/section/subsection/subsection' }
      ]}
    />
  </Story>
</Preview>
