# Anchor list

A list of anchors. Items that contain links to the current page are
marked as active. Useful for navigation menus.

<Primary />
<Controls />


## How it works

An item whose link is for the current page will have a an `active` BEM
class modifier put on it allowing you to style it in your CSS / SASS
code.


## Stories
### Standard

A standard Anchor list. In this case the default `<ul>` list is used.

<Canvas of={Stories.Standard} />


### Ordered list

By passing the `as` prop it is possible to use an ordered `<ol>` list instead.

<Canvas of={Stories.Ordered} />
