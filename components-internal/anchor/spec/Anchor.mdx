# Anchor

A drop in replacement for the standard HTML `<a>` tag that works with [React Router].

<Primary />
<Controls />


## When to use this component

Use this component wherever you would normally use a normal HTML `<a>` tag.


## How it works

It wraps the `Link` component from [React Router] and so allows the router to handle the links without a page reload when possible.


## Stories
### Standard

A standard Anchor.

<Canvas of={Stories.Standard} />

### Title

A link with a title. (Hover over the link to see.)

<Canvas of={Stories.WithTitle} />
